# VillagerUtils

Tools for managing villagers on Spigot servers.

![Editing a villager trade](http://i.imgur.com/pBWpb0d.gif)

* Commands to edit villager trades, professions, biomes and experience levels.

* Log villager deaths with enough information to reasonably recreate them.

* Protect villagers from grief by only allowing WorldGuard region members to harm them.

* Protect villagers from being hurt by blacklisted mob types. e.g. `protect_from_mobs: [Evoker, Evoker_Fangs, Vex, Vindicator]`.

Note that novice villagers select their profession to suit a nearby workstation.
Until a villager has selected a workstation, his skin will not reflect the
villager's current profession. Setting a villager to master level (5) does not
automatically create trades appropriate to their profession.


## Commands
### /villager

The `/villager` command modifies the attributes and trades of the villager 
currently in your crosshairs. The villager must be within 5 blocks or they
will not be "seen".

* `/villager spawn [<biome>] [<profession>] [<level>]` - Convenience command to spawn
  a new villager at your location, optionally setting biome styling, profession
  and level (1-5).

* `/villager name <name>` - Set the villager's name.

* `/villager biome <biome>` - Set the villager's biome, which affects its appearance.

* `/villager profession <profession>` - Set the villager's profession to any valid option.

* `/villager cleartrades` - Clear all trades from a villager. You won't even be able to open the trade UI until you add some new ones.

* `/villager static <boolean>` â€” Set whether the villager will automatically acquire trades. Setting this to false is useful for "server merchants."

* `/villager listtrades` - List all trades offered by the villager you are looking at. Trades are numbered from 1 to the total number of trades.

* `/villager gettrade <position>` - Copy the trade at the specified position to the workspace. (See `/vtrade`.)

* `/villager settrade <position>` - Replace the trade at the specified position with the one on the workspace.

* `/villager addtrade [<position>]` - Add the trade in your workspace to the villager. If a position is specified, the trade is inserted before the existing trade at that position and all subsequent trades are moved down the list. Position 1 signifies the first trade. To add the trade after the last trade, use a position number that is greater than the number of trades, or simply omit the position.

* `/villager removetrade <position>` - Remove the trade at the specified position, from 1 to the number of trades.


### /vtrade

The `/vtrade` command alters the properties of the trade currently on your
"workspace". You can copy a villager's trade to the workspace with
`/villager gettrade` and paste a trade to the same or a different villager
with `/villager settrade` or `/villager addtrade`.

* `/vtrade new [<maxuses>|max]` - Create a new, blank trade that gives experience. If `<maxuses>` is specified, it is the maximum number of times the trade can be used before it locked. Otherwise the number is randomly selected between 2 and 12, inclusive. The word `max` can be used to signify the largest integer (about 2 billion).

* `/vtrade items` - Open an inventory UI to insert 1-2 items for the "cost" and one item for the result of the trade.

* `/vtrade maxuses <int>|max` - Set how many times this trade can be used before it locks, requiring a player to refresh it by using other trades. A blank trade will default to a random number from 2-12, to mimic vanilla distribution. The word `max` can be used to signify the largest integer (about 2 billion).

* `/vtrade givesxp <given>` - Set whether this trade will yield experience or not. The <given> argument must be either `true` or `false`.

* `/vtrade info` - Show a description of the trade currently on your workspace.


## Permissions

* `villagerutils.editvillager` - Allow access to villager-editing commands.
